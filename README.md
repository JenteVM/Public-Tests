# Public Tests
This workspace contains small public-facing test frontends.

## Current projects

- `JVM-Authorization-Tool/` — demo console for the JVM Authorization Tool (see the
	full test console inside that folder). The demo includes a test account:
	- Username: `DemoUser101`
	- Email: `DemoEmail@jvm.place`
	- Password: `1234`
	- DB id: `-` (test is currently unfortunatly offline)

Please don't modify the demo user — it's kept so others can test the system.
